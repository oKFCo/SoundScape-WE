SoundScape is a Flutter-based desktop application designed to enhance your music experience by syncing wallpapers with Spotify tracks. The app dynamically updates your desktop wallpaper to match the currently playing track on Spotify.

## Usage

1. Open the settings and ensure the path to your Wallpaper Engine executable is set.

2. Use the reload button next to the search bar to refresh the wallpaper list.

3. Click on the wallpaper you want to link tracks to.

4. Ensure the Spotify card is visible in the bottom-left corner. If itâ€™s not, play a track on Spotify and wait a few seconds.

5. Once the Spotify card is displayed, click the "Link Track" button next to it to associate the track with the selected wallpaper.

Enjoy!
Thereâ€™s no limit to the number of tracks you can link to a single wallpaper or how many times a track can be linked.
